This project focuses on predicting income levels, classifying them as either below or above $50,000, based on census data. The approach involves employing a neural network model, which is trained using features derived from the census dataset. The project encompasses the following key steps:

Data Preparation:
One-Hot Encoding: Convert categorical variables into binary format.
Standard Scaling: Normalize feature values for consistent data ranges.
Missing Values Handling: Replace any missing values with the mean of their respective features.
Winsorizing: Apply winsorizing to feature values to mitigate the impact of extreme outliers.
Ethical Consideration: Remove sensitive features such as race and sex to ensure fairness and avoid bias in the predictions.
Model Building and Training:

Model Configuration: 
Set up the neural network model with appropriate layers and activations.
L1 Regularization: Incorporate L1 regularization to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use Randomized Search with K-Fold Cross-Validation to identify the optimal hyperparameters, including the learning rate and the number of units in each layer.

Model Evaluation:
Confusion Matrix: Analyze the model's performance using the confusion matrix to understand true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Metrics: Compute and report metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the model's predictive performance.
