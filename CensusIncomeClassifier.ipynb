Missing values will be replaced with the mean of their respective features. To address extreme outliers, I will apply winsorizing to the feature values. I will build the neural network model by configuring the layers and activations, and incorporate L1 regularization to penalize large coefficients to enhance feature selection.\n",

I will then fit the model to the training data and validate it using a validation set. Additionally, I will use K-Fold Cross-Validation to evaluate the model's performance across multiple subsets of the data. Performance metrics such as accuracy and precision will be then analyzed, and I will improve the model using Randomized Search to find optimal hyperparameters."
